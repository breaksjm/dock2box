 If any ethernet adapters were detected at boot (and DHCP is available on your
 network), they should be auto-configured.  Type "net-setup eth0" to specify 
 your eth0 IP address settings by hand.

 Remote access is available via ssh at any time during the bootstrap process.  
 See 'ifconfig eth0' for currently assigned IP address.
